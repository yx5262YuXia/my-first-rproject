\section{Introduction}

This paper talks about incarceration status of different gender and race. In order to examine the difference between different categories, this paper use the data provided by National Longitudinal Survey. I choose NLSY97, which interviewed many American youth in 1997. There are many information about education, employment, marrraige, etc. This paper focuses on the incarceration status in the year 2002.

Firstly, I filter out wrong data. Incarceration data of pervious months are dropped as well. Thus, all incarceration I'm looking at happened in 2002. Thereafter, I categorise the data by race and gender, according to the original data. Meanwhile, I  take the sum of each person's incarceration variable. It shows how many months this person spent incarcerated. For example, If the sum is 9, this person spent 9 months incarcerated. Then I take the mean time of incarceration by each group. As shown below, this paper compare different catefories by figure, simple econometrics model and tables.

\section{Interpretation}

Wherein we do tables and graphs. To include the graph we made in ggplot, we create the \texttt{figure} environment. The `H' option tells LaTeX to `hold' the position of the figure instead of positioning it somewhere else. I use the \texttt{caption} command to add a caption{\textemdash}although I also put a title on the plot in ggplot so you would typically choose one or the other. I use the \texttt{label} command after the caption to add a label. Then in my paper I can use the \texttt{ref} command and LaTeX knows I am referring to Figure \ref{fig:graph}.


\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=.85\textwidth]{incarcerations_by_racegender}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Mean Number of Incarcerations in 2002 by Race and Gender (this is the LaTeX caption, not the ggplot title)}
    \label{fig:graph}
\end{figure}


Tables are somewhat easier, since \texttt{kableExtra} and \texttt{stargazer} generate LaTeX code that is ready to just ``copy-paste'' into our document. The \texttt{label} argument in the R code is the label that the table will have in the tex output, if you want to \texttt{ref} it.
